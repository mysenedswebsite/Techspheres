    <section id="about">
      <h1>What is Biotechnology?</h1>
      <p>Biotechnology involves the use of living organisms, cells, and biological systems to develop products that benefit society. From healthcare innovations to agricultural advancements, biotechnology is playing a key role in addressing global challenges.</p>
      <p>The field is divided into various subfields including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical Biotechnology</li>
        <li>Agricultural Biotechnology</li>
        <li>Environmental Biotechnology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Medical biotechnology focuses on the use of biological systems in medical applications. It is the driving force behind innovations like gene therapies, stem cell research, and biopharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>Agricultural biotechnology is focused on improving food security, pest resistance, and crop yields through genetic engineering and other biotechnological processes.</p>
      <p>Environmental biotechnology uses biological systems to address environmental challenges, such as pollution cleanup and sustainable waste management.</p>
      <p>The advances in these fields have made biotechnology a cornerstone of modern science, with new applications being discovered every day.</p>
      <p>One of the most significant developments is the creation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are used to improve crop resilience and yield, reduce pesticide use, and enhance nutritional content.</p>
      <p>Biotechnology also plays a role in biofuels, using renewable biological resources to produce energy in a more sustainable manner.</p>
      <p>The concept of "synthetic biology" is gaining momentum, which involves redesigning organisms to perform specific tasks, such as producing chemicals or biofuels in a more efficient manner.</p>

    <!-- Innovations in Biotechnology Section -->
    <section id="innovations">
      <h2>Innovations in Biotechnology</h2>
      <p>The production of biopharmaceuticals through biotechnology has revolutionized healthcare, leading to life-saving treatments for conditions like cancer, diabetes, and genetic disorders.</p>
      <p>For instance, biotechnology has made gene therapy possible, allowing for the potential treatment of genetic disorders by altering defective genes.</p>
      <p>Another area where biotechnology is making an impact is in personalized medicine. Through advancements in genomics and biotechnology, treatments can now be tailored to individual patients based on their genetic makeup.</p>
      <p>Biotechnology has also opened up new possibilities in diagnostics. Advances in molecular biology have led to faster, more accurate, and less invasive diagnostic tests for a variety of diseases.</p>
      <p>Biotechnology's contribution to medicine is vast, helping to address unmet medical needs and providing solutions for conditions that were previously untreatable.</p>
      <p>Innovations in agricultural biotechnology are also having a profound effect on food security. GMOs and bioengineering have enabled farmers to grow more resilient crops that are resistant to pests, diseases, and environmental stressors.</p>
      <p>Additionally, advances in plant biotechnology have led to crops that are more nutritious and capable of thriving in regions with harsh growing conditions.</p>
      <p>Environmental biotechnology is equally promising, particularly in addressing environmental pollution. Biotechnology is being used to develop eco-friendly methods for cleaning up oil spills, waste treatment, and reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p>The rise of synthetic biology is pushing biotechnology even further, opening new avenues for the production of renewable chemicals, biofuels, and materials from biomass, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>As biotechnology continues to evolve, it holds immense potential to address critical challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and food security.</p>

    <!-- Ethical and Regulatory Challenges in Biotechnology Section -->
    <section id="resources">
      <h2>Ethical and Regulatory Challenges</h2>
      <p>Despite the remarkable progress biotechnology has made, it also presents a range of ethical challenges that need to be addressed. One of the primary concerns is the potential for bias in biotechnology research and applications.</p>
      <p>Ethical concerns related to genetic manipulation and cloning are often at the forefront of biotechnology debates, particularly regarding the moral implications of modifying human genes or creating genetically altered organisms.</p>
      <p>The regulation of biotechnology products is another significant challenge. Ensuring the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), pharmaceuticals, and other biotechnological innovations requires careful monitoring and testing.</p>
      <p>Countries around the world have established regulatory bodies to assess the safety of biotechnology products. These agencies are responsible for ensuring that biotechnological innovations are safe for consumers and the environment.</p>
      <p>The approval process for biotechnology products, especially in the food and drug industries, can be lengthy and expensive, which may limit access to these technologies in certain regions.</p>
      <p>There are also concerns about the environmental impact of biotechnological developments. The introduction of genetically modified organisms into the ecosystem, for example, has led to debates about the long-term ecological effects.</p>
      <p>Public perception plays a crucial role in the regulation and acceptance of biotechnology. As new biotechnological products and processes are introduced, there is a need for transparent communication with the public about their benefits and risks.</p>
      <p>Another pressing issue is the accessibility of biotechnology innovations. While biotechnology has the potential to improve global health and agriculture, it is essential to ensure that these benefits are accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status.</p>
      <p>To address these challenges, it is important for scientists, policymakers, and the public to engage in open discussions about the ethical, legal, and social implications of biotechnology.</p>
